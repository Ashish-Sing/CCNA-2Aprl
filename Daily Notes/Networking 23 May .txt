DNS( domain name server)
=========================

DNS is like a phoebook. it resolve host IP to domain name. 
DNS lookup - it maintain cache locally in the qureying or centralized server. 

Take a server in packet tracer and on the DNS service
add hostname and ip address as per n/w


R1#ping R2
Translating "R2"...domain server (255.255.255.255)
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.10.20.2, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 0/3/13 ms


#issue
unable to ping R1
reason- wrong dns server ip meantioned so first we have to remove the exiting dns ip config and replace it with correct ip



R3(config)#no ip name-server 10.10.20.1
R3(config)#ip name-server 10.10.10.10

If you check the running configuration then you check the correct intry.

ip name-server 10.10.10.10


pipe/grep command--output of leftside pipe symbol is input of right side of pipe symbol
R3#show running-config | include name
hostname R3
ip name-server 10.10.10.10
R3#
